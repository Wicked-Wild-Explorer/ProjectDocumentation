        <p>This project is a web-based task management tool designed to help individuals and teams stay organized and efficiently manage their tasks and projects. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to create, prioritize, and track tasks, ensuring they can stay on top of their work and meet deadlines effectively.
            The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development, while the back-end is built using Node.js and Express.js. The database is implemented using MongoDB to store task data securely.
            The problem this project aims to solve is the challenge of task management in a fast-paced work environment. Many individuals and teams struggle to keep track of their tasks and often rely on inefficient methods like sticky notes or scattered digital files. This project provides a centralized and intuitive solution to help users organize and prioritize their tasks, increasing productivity and reducing stress.</p>

  <h3>Example 1: Task Creation</h3>
  <p>
    The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a new task using the project's API:
  </p>
  <code>
    // Make a POST request to the tasks endpoint to create a new task
    POST /api/tasks
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "title": "New Task",
      "description": "This is a new task",
      "dueDate": "2023-06-30"
    }
  </code>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send a POST request to the `/api/tasks` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the task details.</li>
    <li>Include the `"title"`, `"description"`, and `"dueDate"` fields in the payload to specify the task information.</li>
    <li>Replace `"New Task"`, `"This is a new task"`, and `"2023-06-30"` with the desired task title, description, and due date respectively.</li>
  </ul>
